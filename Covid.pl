* Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
* Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
* Get vaccinated when it is your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
* Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
* Stay home if you feel unwell.

If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct
you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.

Masks

Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not
protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your

* Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus.
* If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days.
* While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies.
* Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.
* Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.
* Clean your hands frequently.
* Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.
* Keep the room well-ventilated.
* If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart.
* Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days.
* Call your health care provider immediately if you have any of these danger signs: difficulty breathing, loss of speech or mobility,
  confusion or chest pain.
* Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home.

Medical treatments

* Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.
  Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced
  respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.
* Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe
  and critical illness'))),
